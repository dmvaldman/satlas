        <h1>Privacy Policy for Satlas</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: [Date]</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Satlas. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and handle your information when you use our application. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it. By using Satlas, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
        <p>A core principle of Satlas is that sharing personal data is optional. You can use the app to view content without creating an account or providing any personal information.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>

        <h3>A. Information You Provide to Us</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you choose to create an account using a third-party service like Google or Apple (OAuth), we receive information from that service, such as your name, email address, and profile picture. We use this information solely for authentication purposes and to display it in your profile within the app.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> If you choose to contribute content, we collect the information you provide. This includes:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Images:</strong> Photos you upload to the app.</li>
                    <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> The geographical location associated with the images you upload. You can provide this data either from the image's metadata or by manually selecting a location on the map.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Information Collected for Service Operation</h3>
        <ul>
             <li><strong>Crash and Performance Data:</strong> We use services like Sentry to identify crashes and performance issues in our app. This service may collect de-identified data about your device and app usage at the time of a crash to help us diagnose and fix problems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the Satlas service.</li>
            <li>To authenticate your account and prevent fraud.</li>
            <li>To display your username and user-generated content (images and their locations) to other users as part of the app's functionality.</li>
            <li>To respond to your support requests and questions.</li>
            <li>To monitor and analyze usage to improve the app's functionality and user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Your Control Over Your Data</h2>
        <p>We believe you should have full control over your data. All data you provide is optional, and you have the following rights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access and Update:</strong> You can access and update your profile information at any time through the profile settings in the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> You can delete any content you have uploaded. Furthermore, you can delete your entire account at any time from the profile settings screen. Account deletion is permanent and will erase all of your data from our systems, including your profile information, uploaded images, and any other contributions. Please refer to our <a href="/delete-account.html">Account Deletion Instructions</a> for detailed steps.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use trusted third-party services like Firebase (a Google company) to securely store your data.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Satlas is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
